awk和sed用法-实际应用中小技巧

### 适用人群
初学者、开发人员日常筛选日志或者写一写简单的shell脚本，[学习站点](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands)，基础的语法就不提了，主要记录一下常用的命令，加深记忆

### awk

#### OPTIONS
| Tag                                      | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| -F FS--field-separator FS                | Use FS for the input field separator (the value of the 'FS' predefined variable). |
| -f PROGRAM-FILE--file PROGRAM-FILE       | Read the awk program source from the file PROGRAM-FILE, instead of from the first command line argument. |
| -mf NNN-mr NNN                           | The 'f' flag sets the maximum number of fields, and the 'r' flag sets the maximum record size. These options are ignored by 'gawk', since 'gawk' has no predefined limits; they are only for compatibility with the Bell Labs research version of Unix awk. |
| -v VAR=VAL--assign VAR=VAL               | Assign the variable VAR the value VAL before program execution begins. |
| -W traditional-W compat--traditional--compat | Use compatibility mode, in which 'gawk' extensions are turned off. |
| -W lint--lint                            | Give warnings about dubious or non-portable awk constructs. |
| -W lint-old--lint-old                    | Warn about constructs that are not available in the original Version 7 Unix version of awk. |
| -W posix--posix                          | Use POSIX compatibility mode, in which 'gawk' extensions are turned off and additional restrictions apply. |
| -W re-interval--re-interval              | Allow interval expressions, in regexps.  |
| -W source=PROGRAM-TEXT--source PROGRAM-TEXT | Use PROGRAM-TEXT as awk program source code. This option allows mixing command line source code with source code from files, and is particularly useful for mixing command line programs with library functions. |
| --                                       | Signal the end of options. This is useful to allow further arguments to the awk program itself to start with a '-'. This is mainly for consistency with POSIX argument parsing conventions. |
| 'Program'                                | A series of patterns and actions         |
| Input-File                               | If no Input-File is specified then awk applies the Program to "standard input", (piped output of some other command or the terminal. Typed input will continue until end-of-file (typing 'Control-d') |

#### 常见用例
```shell
cat smaple.txt
Sample Line 1
Sample Line 2
Sample Line 3

awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max = length($0) } END { print max }' sample.txt
13

# 表达式计算
awk 'BEGIN { for (i = 1; i <= 7; i++) print int(101 * rand()) }'
24
29
85
15
59
19
81

# 统计行数
awk 'END { print NR }' sample.txt
3

```

> $N 指定第N列，N=0为全文
> NR 行数
> NF 不为空的总行数
> print 打印关键字，必须在{}内使用
